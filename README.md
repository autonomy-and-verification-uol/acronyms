# Acronyms

Acronyms used within the lab, as CSV and as Latex acronyms.

acronyms.tex is a Latex file of acronyms compatible with the glassaries package. It was generated by a simple (probably dodgy) [tool I wrote}(https://github.com/mluckcuck/CSV2GLS) that converted them from csv files of acronyms.

To use it, add:
`\usepackage[xindy]{glossaries}`
`\loadglsentries{acronyms}`

to the document preamble and copy acronyms.tex into the root source folder for the document. The glossaries package can be found on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries) aong with its documentation.

The RAI Hubs folder contains a spreadsheet, and corresponding csv files, of the initial acronyms used to generate the acronyms file. But they have not been kept up to date as the acronyms.tex file has been added to.
